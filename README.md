# AtliQ Hardware Power BI Project

Welcome to the AtliQ Hardware Power BI project! In this guided project, we'll explore how Power BI has been used to empower data-driven decision-making in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. 

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is an electronic manufacturing company with a significant market share in hardware products across different countries. They operate through various channels, including retailers, distributors, and both brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms. However, they faced challenges in collecting and analyzing data from diverse sources like SQL databases, Excel sheets, and CSV files, hindering their ability to make informed decisions and take corrective actions.

As a dedicated data analyst, my mission was to revolutionize their data landscape and enhance their decision-making processes. Here's what we accomplished:

## Objectives

### Project Charter Implementation 🎯

- We started by creating a well-structured Project Charter to guide our efforts, ensuring alignment, scope definition, and accountability throughout the project.

### Benchmark-Backed Data Validation 📈

- We extracted and transformed data with more than 1 million rows, ensuring it met the company's benchmarks to maintain the highest data quality standards.

### Data Modeling Excellence 🔄

- We designed robust data models of more than 10 tables using Star and Snowflake Schema methodologies, providing enhanced clarity by differentiating between fact and dimension tables.

### Transforming Data with Power Query 💡

- Power Query was used to transform raw data into meaningful insights, ensuring our team had the right information at their fingertips.

### Optimized Reports for Seamless Insights 📊

- We focused on report optimization, reducing file sizes, and enhancing user experiences for smoother navigation.

### Stakeholder Mapping Analysis 🎯

- We conducted a comprehensive Stakeholder Mapping Analysis to identify key stakeholders, their influence, interest, and potential impact on the project's success, enabling more effective communication and tailored engagement strategies.

### Finance Insights Unveiled 💰

- For the Finance department, we engineered a dynamic P&L table structure using DAX, providing a comprehensive financial overview with dynamic queries for flexible data filtering.

### Sales Performance Redefined 📊

- Sales were given a new dimension with dynamic Performance Matrix visuals, GM% & NS$ Trends through Tooltips, alongside Customer, Product Performance, and Unit Economics insights.

### Marketing Analytics at its Best 📣

- The Marketing team gained valuable insights through carefully crafted visuals and a Toggle button to switch between two visuals for strategic decision-making.

### Supply Chain Visibility Achieved 📦

- Supply Chain reports help executives monitor Inventory Forecasts and Net Error and take corrective measures if needed.

### Executive Dashboard 👨‍💼

- KPI visuals with detailed data matrix offered executives a clear view of operational performance with market share data, enabling informed decision-making.

### Unleashing the Power of Power BI Services 🚀

- We guided the team through Power BI Services, including report sharing, Apps, and automatic data refresh for real-time insights.

This journey has been about empowering AtliQ Hardware with data-driven insights. As we move forward, we're excited to see the positive impact these insights will have on the company's growth trajectory. Here's to smarter decisions and a brighter future! 📈🔗
